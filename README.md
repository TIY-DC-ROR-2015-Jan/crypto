Example solutions for [this gist on the letter counter assignment](https://gist.github.com/jamesdabbs/74a1b07e6747ecb2f32c).

There are two files: `letter_counter.rb` which contains reasonable solutions and `l3tt3r_c0unter.rb` which is noticably more l33t. Note the use of `Enumerable` methods. Which of those "improvements" really make it more readable?
